Abstract
========

In the interest of maintaining a sustainable structure within CIDA, the 
divisions between groups based on function should be broken down.  Teams
that are composed of members from different functional units will enhance
communication and collaboration between those units.  There has been a
history of walls between these units which prevent such beneficial commun-
ication.

I propose adding a member of the developer team to the newly formed data
science team for several reasons.  First, this position will act to prevent
a wall forming between this group and others which will negatively impact
CIDA overall.  Secondly, such a position will benefit the data science team
as someone with a computer science background can lend that expertise to
the overall goal of the team.  Lastly, such a position may blaze a path for
career advancement within the computer scientist position that will help
with recruitment.

Rationale
=========

The goal of the teams at CIDA should not be to collect a group of people
with the same background, but rather they should collect a group of people
with a similar approach to solving the problems that are presented to CIDA.
The existing data science team is utilizing some of CIDAs best-practes
combinded with novel scientific research to establish a new approach to the
challenges CIDA is attempting to counter.  With this approach, this team
distinguishes itself from the rest of CIDA, but will best accomplish its
goals with a cross-functional team.

One of the directives of the data science team is to publish research that
shows off the work of CIDA, the OWI, and the USGS.  Much of this work will
be done by feeding off APIs produced by developers within all three of the
aforementioned groups.  Having a developer who has been a part of these
projects and can help to understand and enhance the underlying frameworks
will benefit the team as a whole.  Adding to architectural decisions and
integration with other CIDA projects is another benefit of having a developer
on the team will have.

The goal of cross-functional teams is prevalent within CIDA, but defining
that goal is somewhat difficult.  One definition that seems to be making
its rounds is that everyone on a team is able to take on any task that is
presented to the team.  While this is a goal that has its merits, a
definition that fits better is a group of people with different functional
expertise working toward a common goal [_1].  By being a cross-functional
team, the data science team will integrate better with CIDA and be more
able to accomplish its goals.

A growing issue within the development group is recruitment.  Qualified
persons are difficult to find, and harder to hire.  One point that might
aid in recruitment would be for different career paths that one could
take.  The RGE and EDGE [_2] programs allow for advancement based on
accomplishments in research and development.  Currently this is an untested
approach for computer scientists, especially for CIDA.  Having this option
available would help especially if looking for candidates with a more
academic background (e.g. Computer Science or Electrical Engineering Graduate
Students).  Currently this path would most likely be set through efforts
taken on by the data science team.

Duties
======

As a member of the data science team, the developer role would include:

- Act as a liason between the data science team and the other developers.

- Keep track of services and APIs that might be of use to data science
team and advocate for any additions that might be helpful.

- Act as a developer on projects that fall in the skillset of the
traditional developers but the goals of the data science team.

- Keeping up with trends in development of methods to work with big data,
complex models, and scalable processing.

- Provide architectural reviews for software developed within the data
science team.

- Perform research related to work being done within CIDA, OWI, and the
Water mission area.

- Put together a portfolio to present to the RGE/EDGE board to get an
evaluation for position.

Transition
==========

Acknowledging that this is a bit of a change, it would be best to plan
the transition to avoid adversely affecting ongoing projects.  The developer
switching should start out at around 25% on the data science team, joining
in on meetings while still working on projects already committed to.  Then
as planning and funding allows the allocation can increase to an eventual
100%.

Additionally, the increased capacity on the data science team will allow
for projects that fit with the goals of the team to be added and tackled
as a joint effort between functional groups.  The flexibility this will
offer should ensure a self-sufficient data science team into the future.

Conclusion
==========

The establishment of a data science team was a smart move for CIDA and the
OWI.  Furthering its effectiveness through tighter integration with the
rest of CIDA will benefit both the team and CIDA.  Working within a different
work structure allows for multiple approaches to solving the science problems
presented to the USGS.  Introducing multiple functions into the separate
approaches allows for fully functional teams which can complete tasks
independent of others, while preserving the channels of communication
that make CIDA a unique team and place to work.
